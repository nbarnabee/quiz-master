      I was playing around with Pinia and thought that rewriting an old trivia training project
      would make for the perfect test case: if I wanted to write the page in a proper "Vue-like" way
      I'd need to break it down into components, which would need to share quite a lot of
      information. What better use-case for a state management framework?
    </p>
    <p>
      Continuing on with Vue, I delved a little deeper into the world of reusable form components
      and am in the process of incorporating those.
    </p>
    <p>In the future I'll add unit testing and result tracking.</p>
