Having spent some time going deeper into Vue.js and exploring Pinia, I decided to put what I'd learned into practice and rewrite a project I'd made earlier using vanilla JS: [Trivia Trainer](https://nbarnabee.github.io/api_projects/trivia_trainer/)

This project uses the [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/) ([API documentation](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php))

## Project Setup

Fork repo.

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

### Run Unit Tests with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)

```sh
npm run test:unit
```

### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh
npm run lint
```
